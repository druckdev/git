tar.umask::
	This variable can be used to restrict the permission bits of
	tar archive entries.  The default is 0002, which turns off the
	world write bit.  The special value "user" indicates that the
	archiving user's umask will be used instead.  See umask(2) and
	linkgit:git-archive[1].

tar.<format>.command::
	This variable specifies a shell command through which the tar
	output generated by `git archive` should be piped. The command
	is executed using the shell with the generated tar file on its
	standard input, and should produce the final output on its
	standard output. Any compression-level options will be passed
	to the command (e.g., `-9`).
+
The `tar.gz` and `tgz` formats are defined automatically and use the
magic command `git archive gzip` by default, which invokes an internal
implementation of gzip.

tar.<format>.remote::
	If true, enable the format for use by remote clients via
	linkgit:git-upload-archive[1]. Defaults to false for
	user-defined formats, but true for the `tar.gz` and `tgz`
	formats.
